# VideoInterest
# This is a program that changes video and screen brightness based on user's mood

/* It checks the user's facial movement, brain waves and pupil dilation to determine the user's interest in the set video. Most people
who lose interest within a video do fully contain and recieve all of the information that is given by the video as of this day in age. The 
program will react to the things as listed before to make the video better for the user to take in the information. Based on their level of
interest, the hack will definitely help one recieve information in the most efficient way possible.*/
